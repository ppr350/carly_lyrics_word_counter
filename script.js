I wanna go, get out of here, I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you
Ooh
This is the part, you've got to say all that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag, we're leaving tonight when everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'll run away with you
Ooh
'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you
Ooh
Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner, in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Up in the clouds, high as a kite, over the city, city
We never sleep, we never try, when you are with me, with me
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here with you
Ooh
'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you
Ooh
Oh baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner, in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Oh baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Hold on to me
I never want to let you go
(Run away with me, run away with me)
Over the weekend
We could turn the world to gold, oh oh
(Run away with me, run away with me)
Over the weekend we could turn the world to gold
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh my baby, take me to the feeling
(Take me to, take me to it)
I'll be your sinner, in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me (just run away with me)
Run away with me (away with me, yeah, yeah)
Every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me `;

Wonder, wonder how I do
How's the weather? Am I better?
Better now that there's no you?
Drink tequila for me babe
Let it hit you cold and hot
Let your feelings be revealing
That you can't forget me
Not a flower on the wall
I am growing ten feet, ten feet tall
In your head and I won't stop
Until you forget me, get me not
In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion
I feel it
This emotion
You feel it
All that we could do with this emotion
Paint a picture for me, boy
With the skies forever blue
Tell me there is nothing
I can't have and nothing you won't do
Toss and turn without me, boy
Let it hit you cold and hot
All my kisses, say you'll miss it
And you can't forget me
Not a flower on the wall
I am growing ten feet, ten feet tall
In your head and I won't stop
Until you forget me, get me not
In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion
I feel it
This emotion
You feel it
All that we could do with this emotion
What if I turn the lights right down?
I feel it
What if I turn the lights right down?
You feel it
You and me in the dark right now
I feel it
In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me

Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah, we could stay alone, you and me in this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by thread, baby
Late night watching television
But how we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something

And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
Who gave you eyes like that?
Said you could keep them
I don't know how to act
Or if I should be leaving
I'm running out of time
Going out of my mind
I need to tell you something
Yeah, I need to tell you something, yeah!
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
