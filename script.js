Don't ask me, I'll never tell

And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way
Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still, you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight, and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way
Your stare was holdin'

Hot night, wind was blowin'

I missed you so bad, I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad

And ice cream castles in the air
Feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
Now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons, and Junes, and ferris wheels
The dizzy, dancing way you feel
When every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
Now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say I love you right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads
They say I've changed
Well, something's lost and something's gained in living every day
I've looked at life from both sides now
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
I really don't know life at all`;

Why you gotta make it hurt so good?
I don't ever wanna let you go
We could take it fast or make it slow
I'm the friend that you misunderstood
Everyday is just a wish I could
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?
So good
Imagine you, imagine me
Together so happily
Imagine me, imagine you
Inside a dream I built for two
When you walk into the room
I can't speak and I can't move
You don't see me but you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?
I don't ever wanna let you go
We could take it fast or make it slow

Everyday is just a wish I could
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

You're all I'm looking for
What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are, to me
You're not tryna be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me (To me)
It's how you take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say
I wish somehow I could say them now
Oh, I could say them now, yeah
Just friends, the beginning or the end?
How do we make sense, when we're on our own?
It's like you're the other half of me
I feel incomplete, yeah, should have known
Nothing in the world compares
To the feelings that we share
So not fair
What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are, to me
You're not tryna be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me (To me)
You try to take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say
I wish somehow I could say them now, oh
It's not you, blame it all on me
I was running from myself
'Cause I couldn't tell how deep that we
We were gonna be
I was scared, it's destiny, but it hurts like hell
Hope it's not too late, just a twist of fate, yeah
What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are, to me
You're not tryna be perfect

And I wanna be brave enough for everything

You crush all the competition
You can ask me if I'm busy tonight
I could be free for you and me
And maybe we can go for a drive
So light, keep it easy
'Cause I'm kinda independent
But I really need to stay on your mind
No other guy can help me fly
And hold me down at the same time
So nice
Incredibly honest
Polite
So nice, all night
He's right to me
It's turning me on that
He's the kind of superstar
That would only steal your heart
So nice
La, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la-la (la, la, la, la)
La, la, la, la-la (all of the reasons I know)
La, la, la, la-la
I'm back in the middle of what could be complicated
But it's different, yeah, it's easy this time
Communicate, don't make me wait
And say whatever comes to your mind (I love you)
So nice
Incredibly honest
Polite (polite)
So nice, all night
He's right to me
It's turning me on that
He's the kind of superstar
That would only steal your heart
So nice
La, la, la, la-la

La, la, la, la-la (give me all of the reasons)
La, la, la, la-la (all of the reasons)

He's my cup of tea
Sugar on my street
Hope he never leaves
I hope he never leaves me
'Cause he's all of the reasons I know
Give me all of the reasons
Apple of my eye
He took me by surprise
He swept me off my feet
I hope he never leaves me
'Cause he's all of the reasons I know
Give me all of the reasons `;

Press my back against the door
Of the refrigerator when the heatwave comes
Ice can't melt how hot we felt
But I still believe in my New York City
Lots to do and the boys so pretty
Can't believe I've been gone so long
We can turn it on
Just sweat all my fears away
Dancing through the dark
Saw your angel face
Caught my shooting star
I got you now, I'm a Scorpio
It's physical, it's natural
My spiritual, my animal

Go find yourself or whatever
And I wake up alone, you made me vulnerable
So go find yourself or whatever
I hope it treats you better than I could do
And I'll wait for you
Tell me that we'll meet up someday
I'll tell you that I'm no good at tellin' lies
Maybe when my heart's done breakin'
Then I could forgive what you've tried
You feel safe in sorrow

'Cause our love we never finished it
I'm coming over tonight
Knock on your door just like before
I need that look in your eyes (look in your eyes)
'Cause we've had the loneliest time (loneliest time)
I'm thinking all through the night (all through the night)

I've had more of those bad dreams
You were ten feet in front of me
I went running but I couldn't catch
Just the shadow of your silhouette
Then you spoke the words to me
When you left, I still need to unpack it
Let's save sorry for another night
'Cause this time, love, we're gonna get it right
I'm coming over tonight (over tonight)
Knock on your door just like before

What happened was
We reached the moon
But lost in space, I think we got there all too soon
But you know what
I'm coming back for you, baby

Lavender sunset, ocean air

Wake me up when you're ready for the water
Do you think about star signs?
'Cause I think I saw Jupiter
Dive into the black sky
No thinking over the weekend (our lips have no secrets)
No thinking over the weekend (this love has no limits)

No thinking (thinking, thinking, thinking)
Holiday, take the train off the track
The windows were closed, so we kick the door open
Everyone waved at us

Dive into the black sky

Hard to keep it cool, I know you want me too

Gonna need some land between our bodies though
I'm trying to keep away from you
I, can't control the things I do
God, I miss your hands over my body though
I'm trying to keep away from you
Think of this time, it's now or never
You've made your mind up and I surrender
My heart was blind, I wish I never knew this kind of love
I'm keeping company
Company with all the friends I got from you
It's not easy, you said, I think you're onto me
It's hard to keep it cool, I know you want me too
It takes over my pain
I, I'm trying to keep away from you
We're gonna need some land between our bodies though
I'm trying to keep away from you
I, can't control the things I do
God, I miss your hands over my body though

I'm trying keep away from you (keep away, away - keep away, away)
(Keep away, away - keep away, away)
I'm trying keep away from you (keep away, away - keep away, away)
Just one word from you and I run out of reasons
Waking up, making up for the last time
Just one word from you and I'm all out of reasons
Close the door, I've been yours for the longest time
God, I miss your hands over my body (keep away, away - keep away, away)
