I wanna go, get out of here, I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you
Ooh
This is the part, you've got to say all that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag, we're leaving tonight when everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'll run away with you
Ooh
'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you
Ooh
Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner, in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Up in the clouds, high as a kite, over the city, city
We never sleep, we never try, when you are with me, with me
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here with you
Ooh
'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you
Ooh
Oh baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner, in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Oh baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Hold on to me
I never want to let you go
(Run away with me, run away with me)
Over the weekend
We could turn the world to gold, oh oh
(Run away with me, run away with me)
Over the weekend we could turn the world to gold
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh my baby, take me to the feeling
(Take me to, take me to it)
I'll be your sinner, in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me (just run away with me)
Run away with me (away with me, yeah, yeah)
Every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me`;

Wonder, wonder how I do
How's the weather? Am I better?
Better now that there's no you?
Drink tequila for me babe
Let it hit you cold and hot
Let your feelings be revealing
That you can't forget me
Not a flower on the wall
I am growing ten feet, ten feet tall
In your head and I won't stop
Until you forget me, get me not
In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion
I feel it
This emotion
You feel it
All that we could do with this emotion
Paint a picture for me, boy
With the skies forever blue
Tell me there is nothing
I can't have and nothing you won't do
Toss and turn without me, boy
Let it hit you cold and hot
All my kisses, say you'll miss it
And you can't forget me
Not a flower on the wall
I am growing ten feet, ten feet tall
In your head and I won't stop
Until you forget me, get me not
In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion
I feel it
This emotion
You feel it
All that we could do with this emotion
What if I turn the lights right down?
I feel it
What if I turn the lights right down?
You feel it
You and me in the dark right now
I feel it
In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion

Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah, we could stay alone, you and me in this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by thread, baby
Late night watching television
But how we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something

And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
Who gave you eyes like that?
Said you could keep them
I don't know how to act
Or if I should be leaving
I'm running out of time
Going out of my mind
I need to tell you something
Yeah, I need to tell you something, yeah!
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you

Do you know what I mean?
If you just give me a chance, you'd see what I see
You'd see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you just give me a chance, you'd see what I see
You'd see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance
Baby I, I'm not going anywhere without you
Drive me home, 'cause I like every single thing about you
Hey, Joe's calling me over
Tino is calling me over
I only came here for you
It's you boy, you in the corner
Something is taking me over
I only came here for you
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you just give me a chance, you'd see what I see
You'd see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you just give me a chance, you'd see what I see
You'd see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance
Hey, Joe's calling me over
Tino is calling me over
I only came here for you
It's you boy, you in the corner
Something is taking me over
I only came here for you
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you just give me a chance, you'd see what I see
Do you see what I see?`

This is getting kinda serious
This is getting kinda out of control
Out of control
Slow down now
Breathing heavy when it's just a kiss
This is getting kinda out of my hands
Out of my hands
Please don't go, look real close
Eyes that show kaleidoscopes
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue, falling into you
Falling for each other
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue, falling into you
Falling for each other
Should I stay?
Making love until the morning light
Making out like it's the end of the world
And I really wanna get it right
But it's getting hard to slow down
Got me feeling like it's real for sure
This is getting kinda out of my head
I'm out of my head 'cause
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue, falling into you
Falling for each other
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue, falling into you
Falling for each other
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
Please don't go, look real close
Eyes that show kaleidoscopes
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue, falling into you
Falling for each other
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue, falling into you
Falling for each other
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour`

You know I didn't mean it, darling
Sweet like the morning light
Goes late into the evening
All I want is to hold you
Make you rock away this feeling for me
Oh baby, don't you go
You know I didn't mean it
Until I saw you in my thunderstorm
I didn't see
I wanna be the one that's in your arms
I wanna feel you
I never get to hold you
As long as I want to
Remember I told you
You're all that I need
You're all that I need
I never get to hold you
As long as I want to
Remember I told you
You're all that I need
You're all that I need, baby
Oh sugar, sugar, spice and all things nice
I'll be there for you
Just say you'll stay the night
I need you 'til the morning light
'Cause oh darling, don't you know
My only heart is beating for you
Oh baby, don't you go
You know I didn't mean it
Until I saw you in my thunderstorm
I didn't see
I wanna be the one that's in your arms
I wanna feel you
I never get to hold you
As long as I want to
Remember I told you
You're all that I need
You're all that I need
I never get to hold you
As long as I want to
Remember I told you
You're all that I need
You're all that I need, baby
But I don't think that anybody understands you
The way I do, the way I do
I know you'll let it go your head
If I say I'll stay
I don't think that anybody understands you
The way I do, the way I do
I know you'll let it go your head
If I say I'll stay
I never get to hold you
As long as I want to
Remember I told you
You're all that I need
You're all that I need
I never get to hold you
As long as I want to
Remember I told you
You're all that I need
You're all that I need, baby`

Don't you know it hurts for a reason?
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
Stars, won't you shine on me?
Won't you dance with me?
Me and my baby
Life is enough to cry
It's a lot to give and it's driving me crazy
I never meant to fight with you
I wanted us to stay together
And even now my love is true
I know that we can't be together
Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason?
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
Somewhere out there someone is breathing
Just for you their heart keeps on beating
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
Moon, where's the man in you?
Show the way to us
The sky is turning black now
Moon, what you trying to do?
It's too late for us and there's no turning back now
I never meant to fight with you
I wanted us to stay together
And even now our love is true
I know that we can't be together
Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason?
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
Somewhere out there someone is breathing
Just for you their heart keeps on beating
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason?
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
Somewhere out there someone is breathing
Just for you their heart keeps on beating
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again`
